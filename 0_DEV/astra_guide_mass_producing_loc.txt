How to mass-produce name loc from name lists, via using notepad++:

1. get the names isolated into a new text file

2. in notepad++, open up find > replace and do

Find what :  (just put a single space here)

Replace with : :0\n

check 'extended' search mode and click replace all. for some reason not all of the names get appended sometimes, so you may have to do this:

find: ^(?!.*:0).*$
replace: ($0):0
MAKE SURE you do this one manually instead of 'replace all' as it catches blank lines as well.

3. do another find > replace:

Find what : ^([\w\-\']+)(.*)
Replace with : \1\2 "\1"
Search mode :"Regular expression"
this one you can do 'replace all' for

and now you are done, make sure to give everything a look over so theres no weird messups
