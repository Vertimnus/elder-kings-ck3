2E 440 - Warlord Rising - Engine Year: 3360
Warlord Attrebus pushing the Akaviri out of Cyrodiil (Cyrodiil civil war between tsaesci and attrebus), Skyrim Civil war (west vs east), High Rock, Elsweyr and Valenwood falling apart, last days of the Bretons and Redguard invading/besieging Orsinium (at location of 1st Orsinium), orc chiefdom starting in Falkreath

Cyrodiil: locked in a civil war between Attrebus and the Council on one side and the tsaesci loyalist on the other. if attrebus wins he has three options: 
- abdicate and become duke of smth, the imperial commune takes over
- stays king till his death, then imperial commune takes over
- goes full pretender and tries to establish himself as the new ruler of cyrodiil

If the Tsaesci loyalists win, a new potentate is taking over cyrodiil only.


High Rock:
The Breton Province has already dissolved into minor kingdoms, largest ones being wayrest, daggerfall, evermore and schornhelm + various smaller factions. The breton kingdoms are besieging Orsinium. While many smaller vassals push for independence against their breton lieges, claiming that their vassal contracts were only valid under imperial law.

The former imperial governour stayed in High Rock and consolidated a kingdom for himself, he died 3 years ago. His daughter rules ever since.


Redguards:
Hammerfell is still a high kingdom, barely lost any territory yet. they also besiege Orsinium.
The High Kingdom is graduetly loosing land in the east and south - the Abecean isles and Hews Bane became independent, the former under various pirate factions, the latter a republic criminals posing as "noble" houses.


Orsinium/Wrothgar:
Most of their baronies/counties in enemy hands. very hard/impossible to win.
The Reachfolk in the eastern parts of Wrothgar stand ready to reclaim their homeland (less under their control than in 450/3370)


Skyrim:
West Skyrim vs East Skyrim in a civil war. “historically” it ends in a truce. (and the Skyrim fanpeople get their West vs East civil war)
The Jarl of the Reach is isolated in Markarth, surrounded by the native reachfolk tribes which have risen up in revolution.
In Falkreath, first refugees of Orsinium try to take the Hold.

Morrowind: stays as it is, might be invading black marsh as that isn’t protected by the empire anymore (see 3370)

Black Marsh: dissolved into small tribes (see 3370)
Two Imperial Holdouts:
- Gideon, adjacent to Cyrodiil, stays out of the Civil war
- Black Rose or Lilmoth, isolated, sees themselves surrounded by the native argonian tribes

Elsweyr: the confederacy dissolves into Anequina and pelletine and soon even smaller factions (see 3370)

Valenwood: Multiple Camoran Cadet Branches rise up in revolution, trying to take the throne from the Camoran King of Valenwood.

Alinor: see 3370
