The Yokudan creation myth involved Sep, a "crazy" merchant god who convinced the others to create the mortal world to make it easier for more spirits to survive Satakal's inevitable onslaught. Except it didn't make it easier. Rather, the mortal plane acts as a trap and makes apotheosis even harder. In this way, the Redguard view of creation has more in common with the Elven tradition than that of other humans, who view the mortal plane as a blessing."
