The Heart of Lorkhan is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be divine. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was facing the Nerevarine, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he welcomed the Nerevarine to the Heart Chamber, then the Nerevarine used the Tools on the Heart. Ironic. He could keep the Tribunal from The Heart, but was kept himself."
