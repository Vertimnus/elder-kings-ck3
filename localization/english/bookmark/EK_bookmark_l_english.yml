 # Warlord Rising - Cyrodiil
 bm_warlordrising_cyrodiil:0 "Warlord Rising"
 bm_warlordrising_cyrodiil_desc:0 "It has been ten years since the vile Akaviri Potentate was assassinated by the Morag Tong. Yet some Tsaesci still cling to the Imperial City, supported by powerful Nibenese nobility in the east. It is time someone disposed of them.\n\nThe stage is set for the young Attrebus Sossildor — a fanatical follower of the Eight and sworn enemy of Daedra worship and other outlandish beliefs — who has succeeded in uniting the Colovian kingdoms into the Colovian Estates and now stands as Cyrodiil's protector.\n\nMost Nibenese, however, remain loyal to the Tsaesci, fearful of losing their influence over the Heartlands. Meanwhile, chaos breaks out all over Tamriel as the inevitable Interregnum threatens to shatter what is left of the Empire. \n\n#bold Will Attrebus restore what seems lost, or will the "days and nights of blood and venom" reign?#!"
 bm_warlordrising_attrebus:0 "General Attrebus"
 bm_warlordrising_attrebus_desc:0 "A zealous warrior, Attrebus was raised in the Abbey of the Eight to serve and dedicate himself to the Eight Divines. Radicalized by the Potentate distaste for the gods, he mustered an army with like-minded rulers in Colovia and vowed to overthrow the Potentate and their heathen vassals.\n\n#bold The upcoming war will determine the fate of Tamriel. Will Attrebus's efforts fail, ensuring the Potentate stays the central power in the Imperial Province? Or can you shatter the Potentate, lay claim to the Red Dragon Crown of the Cyrodiils, and become the True Emperor of Tamriel?#!"

 bm_warlordrising_aixnieras_ves_desc:0 "The grandson of the previous Potentate, Savirien-Chorak, Aixnieras-Ves was quickly taken from his vacation place when the Morag Tong struck his grandfather and father. Not expecting to rule for at least a few more centuries, the new Potentate has almost impossible challenges to face. With the warlord Attrebus in the west, the remaining vassals of the Potentate considering independence, and the constant scheming in his own court, how can he expect to prevail and maintain his power in Cyrodiil?\n\n#bold Will the Potentate fall and see his authority crumble as Cyrodiil and Tamriel plunge into an era of chaos and darkness? Or can you take the reins, defeat the clumsy knights of Colovia, and forge a new destiny for Tamriel?#!"

 # Warlord Rising - Skyrim
 bm_warlordrising_skyrim:0 "A Contested Verity"
 bm_warlordrising_skyrim_desc:0 "The home of the Nords stands divided.\n\nAfter High King Logrolf was murdered, the Jarl of Solitude Svartr disputed the heir apparent's legitimacy. As the Moot convened and held Freydis, Logrolf's daughter, as the rightful successor chosen by the Crown of Verity itself, Logrolf held his own Moot in Solitude.\n\nSkyrim would then be divided between its East, ruled by Freydis and her line, and its West, ruled by Svartr and his heirs, for centuries.\n\n#bold Can one pretender crush the other and reunite the province? Or will the Nords stay divided for centuries until an outsider conquers the Nords as their own subject?#!"
 bm_warlordrising_svartr:0 "King Svartr"
 bm_warlordrising_svartr_desc:0 "The aging Jarl of Solitude, Svartr was first to contest Freydis's legitimacy after Logrolf's assassination. Quick to act, he convened a partial Moot within his halls to crown him High King, but not before Freydis managed to hold her own Moot and wear the Crown of Verity. Unwilling to back down, Svartr and his supporters refuse to recognize the Crown of Verity as anything more than a powerless relic, and he would rather be crowned High King due to the strength of his armies.\n\n#bold Will the pretender queen kill Svartr's campaign before it can garner enough support? Or can you take charge, unite Skyrim under your banner, and bring an end to centuries of rule from the east?#!"
 bm_warlordrising_freydis:0 "Queen Freydis"
 bm_warlordrising_freydis_desc:0 "The daughter of the now deceased High King Logrolf, Freydis's lack of unanimous support means her hold on Skyrim's western half is tenuous at best. Svartr, the old Jarl of Solitude, refuses to recognize her as his rightful ruler, and unless she wants Skyrim to stay divided for centuries, Freydis will have to march west and bring back Solitude and Svartr's supporters back into the fold.\n\n#bold Are Freydis and her line doomed to fail? Or can you crush the pretender, unite the province, and finally be crowned High Queen of Skyrim?#!"
 bm_warlordrising_lodvar:0 "Jarl Lodvar"
 bm_warlordrising_lodvar_desc:0 "A Nord king in a Reachfolk kingdom, Lodvar ascended to power after claiming Markarth for himself and defeating the Reachfolk tribes surrounding the city. Most of the Reach is still outside his grasp, and his subjects actively conspire to overthrow him, but he may still find allies to his north and east.\n\n#bold Will the unruly Reachfolk overthrow you and be free once more, or can you turn the Reach into a proper Nord jarldom and civilize the region?#!"
 bm_warlordrising_yashnag:0 "Chief Yashnag"
 bm_warlordrising_yashnag_desc:0 "Following the sack of Orsinium, Yashnag and his tribe fled east to their ancestral land in Skyrim. Svartr, holding power in the western part of the province, was unable to stop the Orcs, and they claimed their chiefdom in Falkreath. After holding Falcrenth for a few decades, Yashnag and his champions were challenged to duels and defeated by the former Jarl of Falkreath's son, Hakkvild.\n\n#bold Surrounded by enemies, will Yashnag and his line fail, leaving the Orcs no choice but to scatter once more? Or will you stay strong, keep the Chiefdom of Falcrenth as Orcish land, and forge a new Orsinium here in the crucible of war?#!"

 # Interregnum
 bm_interregnum:0 "Interregnum"
 bm_interregnum_desc:0 "Twenty years ago, the last Akaviri Potentate and all of his heirs were murdered, ending the Second Empire.\nCyrodiil and High Rock are now split between dozens of rival successor states. Skyrim struggles with civil unrest as two self-proclaimed High Kings strive to claim the province for themselves. Former subjects of the Empire struggle with one another over even the smallest of resources. Most of Tamriel fares no better, with regional hostilities gripping nearly every region outside of Alinor.\n\n#bold In all this chaos, is it possible for the Empire to be restored? Can any individual possibly hope to pacify the turbulence and stand above all others as the Emperor of not only Cyrodiil but also all Tamriel? Anything is possible amidst the chaos of the Interregnum.#!"
 
 # Alliance War
 bm_alliancewar:0 "Alliance War"
 bm_alliancewar_desc:0 "When Mannimarco, the King of Worms, corrupted the Amulet of Kings just before Emperor Varen's coronation ritual several years ago, he guaranteed that the covenant sealed by Alessia and Akatosh would be broken, and Nirn would no longer be protected from a Daedric invasion. Mannimarco's master, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, seized the opportunity to initiate the Planemeld, using terrifying Dark Anchors to summon Daedric troops and drag Nirn into the realm of Coldharbour. But three political alliances — the Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant, and Aldmeri Dominion — stand against the Daedric Prince and his forces.\n\n#bold The armies of the three alliances converge, ready to fight to the last to preserve their freedom. Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.#!"
