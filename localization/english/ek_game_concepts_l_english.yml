 ### ENCYCLOPEDIA
 game_concept_enc_aedra:0 "Aedra"
 game_concept_enc_ancestors:0 "Ancestors"
 game_concept_enc_aedra_desc:0 "Meaning 'Ancestors' in the old Aldmeri tongue, the Aedra are the Gods who helped forge Mundus. They however lost most of their divine power in the process, and are as such bound to take a passive role now, instead of the Daedra who can be much more active. As part of the divine contract of creation, the Aedra are also thought to be killable. The Trickster God Lorkhan, and the Two Moons are thought to have been killed, with their dead body still obversable to this day.\n\nThe Aedra are worshipped through most of Tamriel, but their most known followers would probably be the worshippers of the [enc_divines|E]."
 
 game_concept_enc_alchemy:0 "Alchemy"
 game_concept_enc_alchemy_desc:0 "An art as old as time, alchemy is the process through which someone combines and mixes, boils, or distills several ingredients to form a poison, or a potion. This art was supposedely codified by Asliel Direnni, but most people in Tamriel already knew how boiling a plant could cure a fever, or what bones should one crush to produce a potent poison.\n\nAlchemical ingredients come in very various forms, such as plants or leaves, animal parts, undead remnants, and even Daedric summons. This makes alchemy a potentially very lucrative and very dangerous trade, as the most expensive ingredients produce the most powerful poisons and potions, but are also hidden in the most deadly places."

 game_concept_enc_eight_divines:0 "Eight Divines"
 game_concept_enc_divines_desc:0 "The Eight Divines are the [enc_aedra|E] who maintained most of their divine power even as the creation of Mundus drained most of it. Their worship started under Alessia and her newly forged Empire, as the Elven gods and Nordic deities had to coexist in this new nation.\n\nAs part of the Covenant between Alessia and Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time swore to protect Mundus from further Daedric influence as long as Alessia and her line championned the pantheon throughout Tamriel. Aside from Akatosh, the Eight Divines are made of Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Kynareth, Mara, Stendarr, and Zenithar."
 
 game_concept_enc_magnus:0 "Magnus"
 game_concept_enc_sun:0 "Sun"
 game_concept_enc_magnus_desc:0 "Known as the God of Magic, Magnus was one of the most powerful Original Spirits, the et'Ada. As Lorkhan convinced the other Aedra to create the Mortal Plane, Magnus was known as the 'Architect of Mundus', due to the diagrams and schematics he drew for the other deities to follow.\n\nAfter learning of Lorkhan's treachery Magnus was among the first, and the most powerful, to decide to leave the newly created mortal plane, tearing a hole through the fabric the edge of Mundus, allowing raw energy from Aetherius to pour unto the plane. Those who decided to follow him, the Magna-Ge, teared their own holes as they followed Magnus, which became known as the stars.\n\nHe is still revered in the Altmeri and Breton pantheons, and followers of Magnus can be found throughout Tamriel."
