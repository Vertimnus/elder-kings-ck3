 ek_prison.1001.t:0 "The Blood Price"
 ek_prison.1001.desc_intro:0 "It is custom among the [jailor_culture.GetName] to not use jails or dungeons, but to instead test their physical resistance by letting the jailor, or the person they slighted, draw as much blood as desired."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_no_reason:0 "\n\nWhile most of my alleged crimes against [actor.GetName] were repayed when [actor.GetSheHe] locked me way, there are still some lighter slights [actor.GetSheHe] wants me to answer for."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_imprisonment_reason:0 "\n\nIt seems that [actor.GetName] wants to cut deep and let me bleed away for a while, as the charges against me are rather significant."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_execution_reason:0 "\n\nMy alleged crimes would be enough to get me executed, but [actor.GetName] decided against it and would rather let me bleed for my crimes."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_no_wound:0 "\n\nWhile the knife's blade will hurt, the loss of blood should not have much effect, and I should walk free without too many problems."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_wounded_1:0 "\n\nI am lucky to be otherwise healthy, as the blade's cut and the blood wanted by [actor.GetName] will without a doubt cause damage."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_wounded_2:0 "\n\nThe blade will cut deep, and the blood price will be heavy. But I will get out of it alive, and free."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_wounded_3:0 "\n\nFew could resist the price I have to pay in my state, and I fear that I might die to the blade shortly after I am free."
 ek_prison.1001.desc_death:0 "\n\nI am no fool and know that the blood price is too high and my health already too deteriorated. This is not much more than an execution, and I will bleed to death, prisoner of [actor.GetFirstName]."
