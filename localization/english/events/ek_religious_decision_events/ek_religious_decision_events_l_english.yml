 ### The Ristaag
 ek_religious_decision.0101.t:0 "The Ristaag"
 ek_religious_decision.0101.desc:0 "A sacred ceremony used in times of need, the Ristaag helps us show our gratitude and respect to the All-Maker, by performing a ritual hunt to bless and cleanse the land.\n\nWe will have to find the Totem of Claw and Fang, use it to locate the Spirit Bear sent by the All-Maker, and slay it.\n\nShould the All-Maker be pleased, he will bless our land and people with his soothing touch, and we shall know peace once again."
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a:0 "Begin the search for the Totem!"
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a.tt:0 "The priests and warriors will try to locate where the Totem might be hidden..."
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a.success:0 "You successfully find the Totem!"
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a.tt_success:0 "The Ristaag will continue without issue."
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a.failure:0 "You fail to find the Totem..."
 ek_religious_decision.0101.a.tt_failure:0 "Surely someone will know where it is... Right?"
 
 ek_religious_decision.0102.desc_success:0 "The Totem of Claw and Fang, one of the sacred artifacts of our people, has been found deep within [totem_barony.GetName]!\n\nCreated by the All-Maker ages ago, this Totem blesses us with the power to call forth the power of the land, and to mighty bears by our side.\n\nWe pray to never have to use it for war, but in times of need such as in the Ristaag we can use it to ask the All-Maker to grant us an opportunity to show him our respect and veneration."
 ek_religious_decision.0102.desc_failure:0 "We have searched for days, but unfortunately the Totem still eludes us. There are rumours about it being hidden in [totem_barony.GetName], but so far none of our warriors have been able to find it.\n\nIt is crucial that we get our hand on it, otherwise we will not be able to complete the ritual!"
 ek_religious_decision.0102.a:0 "Summon a Spirit Bear"
 ek_religious_decision.0102.b:0 "I will lead them myself!"
 ek_religious_decision.0102.b.tt_success:0 "When you want something do, do it yourself!"
 ek_religious_decision.0102.c:0 "Oh All-Maker, please guide our way..."
 ek_religious_decision.0102.c.tt_success:0 "Maybe it will be revealed to you in a dream?"
 ek_religious_decision.0102.d:0 "Surely a local will tell us if we pay them..."
 ek_religious_decision.0102.d.tt_success:0 "Everybody likes gold, after all..."
 ek_religious_decision.0102.e:0 "It might not be worth it after all..."
 ek_religious_decision.0102.stop:0 "You will not be able to complete the Ristaag, and will have to return home."
 
 ek_religious_decision.0103.desc:0 "With the power of the Totem of Claw and Fang a mighty Spirit Bear has been summoned. Representing the harshness of the land, slaying it would show the All-Maker that our people are still grateful for all His blessings.\n\nOur warriors are ready, and the Spirit Bear seem to be waiting for you to attack first. Even though you are many, it could defeat most of you, should you not be careful."
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a:0 "The spirit of our people will triumph!"
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.success_1:0 "You and your warriors defeat the Spirit bear!"
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.tt_success:0 "The All-Maker will be pleased by your success."
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.success_2:0 "The Spirit Bear will put up a good fight, but in the end you will triumph."
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.success_3:0 "The Spirit Bear will wound you and down many of your warriors, but you manage to slay it."
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.failure:0 "You are unable to beat the Spirit Bear."
 ek_religious_decision.0103.a.tt_failure:0 "The Ristaag will have to end, and the All-Maker will be disappointed."
 
 ek_religious_decision.0104.desc:0 "The fight was harsh and many fell, but in the end the Spirit Bear was vainquished by the will of our people.\n\nWe can already feel the land getting much quieter, and a soothing presence can be felt all around us. The All-Maker watched us, and is pleased."
 ek_religious_decision.0104.a:0 "Thank you, All-Maker."
 ek_religious_decision.0104.tt:0 "The Ristaag has been a success."
 
 ek_religious_decision.0105.desc:0 "It seems that the All-Maker is not on our side. Unable to finish the Ristaag, we have to go back home, ashamed without anything to show for it.\n\nThe land grows even more restless, and our people claim to still have trouble finding rest..."
 ek_religious_decision.0105.a:0 "Hopefully we will soon find peace..."
 ek_religious_decision.0105.tt:0 "Hopefully you will triumph next time..."
 
 ### Summon a Dragon
 ek_religious_decision.0301.t:0 "Dragon Rising"
 ek_religious_decision.0301.desc:0 "The ritual has been prepared, the scroll is ready. For years we have carefully built up our devotion and our reverence towards the Dragons, and today we will see if it paid off.\n\nAs I take the scroll containing the Dragon's name, I feel the air growing quieter around me.\n'[summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U].' I say.\n'[summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U]!' I shout.\n'[summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U], join us and fight with us!' we all shout.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, we hear a deafening thunder in the distance. Soon after, a vast shadow is cast upon us, and a terrifying creature lands right next to me.\n'I am [summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U]. You called for me. It has been too long since I had a good fight. I will fight by your side, until I grow tired of you. Remember your place, mortal. I am your master.'"
 ek_religious_decision.0301.a:0 "Yes [summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U]."
 ek_religious_decision.0301.a.tt:0 "The Dragon, [summoned_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip|U], will join your war."
