 ek_attrebus_potentate.0001.desc:0 "When [attrebus.GetFirstName] first raised soldiers in the Colovian lands, nobody expected [attrebus.GetHerHis] rebellion to succeed. But as [attrebus.GetHerHis] army grew, so did [attrebus.GetHerHis] support among the nobility, and soon even the Elder Council backed [attrebus.GetHerHis] claim. The war between [attrebus.GetFirstName] and the Akaviri Potentate shook Cyrodiil for years, and now the last remnants of the Akaviri invasion have been forced out of power in the Imperial province!\n\nThe Warlord paraded through an Imperial City full of joy, and it is said that the Elder Council will give [attrebus.GetHerHim] emergency powers until the aftermath of the war are dealt with.\n\n"

The Warlord [attrebus.GetFirstName], a zealot bent on destroying the Akaviri Potentate, seized the Imperial City and with it the crown of Cyrodiil!\n\nWhile it is said that the Elder Council should soon get in power, and become the ruling body of the Imperial Isles, and with it most of the province, the young Warlord will still stay in control for a few weeks or months, to deal with the aftermath of the war...\n\n"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0002.desc.potentate_executed:0 "As [attrebus.GetHerHis] first act, [attrebus.GetFirstName] decided to execute the last Akaviri Potentate, [potentate.GetFirstName]!

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0002.a:0 "What fate awaits the rest of Cyrodiil?"
 
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0003.t:0 "The Tsaesci of Cyrodiil"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0003.desc:0 "Now that the Potentate has been defeated, an urgent matter has to be dealt with. It is of no secret that the Potentate installed some of [potentate.GetHerHis] supporters as rulers in Cyrodiil, and some of the land is still under Akaviri rule.\n\n"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0003.desc.potentate_executed:0 "With the Potentate executed, many of these lords fear for their life, and some are even ready to share a similar fate..."

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0004.desc.tsaesci_exile:0 "It seems that the wrath of [attrebus.GetName] was not to be extinguished after the victory over the Potentate. The Warlord has ordered every Tsaesci ruler to leave the Imperial Province at one, lest they be branded as traitors and criminals!"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0004.desc.tsaesci_kneel:0 "As the war against the Potentate ends, the your Warlord [attrebus.GetFirstName] summoned every Tsaesci vassal in Cyrodiil! Many were anxious about what would happen next, and some were reported to breathe a sign of relief when [attrebus.GetFirstName] ordered them to kneel before the Ruby Throne, and give up many of their former privileges.\n\nThey are now expected to contribute significantly more to the rulers of Cyrodiil."
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0004.desc.tsaesci_let:0 "As the dust settles after the war against the Potentate, [attrebus.GetFirstName] issued an Imperial decree absolving most Tsaesci rulers still in Cyrodiil, as the Warlord does not hold them guilty for the crimes of the former Potentate.\n\nSome members of the Elder Council and the most zealots vassals of the Warlord have protested, fearing that the lack of retribution might embolden a new potential Akaviri Potentate, most agree that Cyrodiil needs peace."

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0005.desc:0 "Among the numerous crimes of the Potentate, perhaps their most severe was their utmost disrespect for the Divines, going as far as to close the Temple of the One and regularly tour in the Temple District, irregarding the religious importance of this part of the Imperial City.\n\nOne of the first concerns brought by one of our religious leaders, [traditionalist_priest.GetFirstName], is to open up the Temple District to religious processions once again, and the holding of a great ceremony in the Temple of the One.\n\n[militant_priest.GetFirstName], on the other hand, proposes that this district be restructured primarly for the housing of a newly created militant order, a new arm of our faith that would defend the Imperial City, and all the faithful, from other snakes and heathens."

 attrebus_leases_temple_district_transform_td:0 "The [temple_district.GetName] will be rebuilt into a Castle holding, and leased to [order.GetName]"
 attrebus_leases_temple_district_unpopular:0 "Only a small part of the clergy would approve of such an action, and as such #R you will lose some of your religious standing#!"
 attrebus_leases_temple_district_militaristic_faith:0 "An ambitious ruler could however use that opportunity to turn the Imperial Cult into a more militaristic and militant faith..."
 attrebus_leases_temple_district_elder_council:0 "Having a military order in the middle of the Imperial City will cause the Elder Council to worry"

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0009.t:0 "A Debt to the Elder Council"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0009.desc:0 "It is no secret that our war against the Potentate could not have been won without the backing of the Elder Council. While they did not have the power to raise armies, most of the members supported us financially, and most of our troops have been recruited, outfitted, and paid thanks to the Elder Council.\n\nA delegation from the Elder Council arrived today, expecting the repayment of some of their expenses.\n\nWhile angering the Elder Council could be dangerous, the price they are asking for might be too high to be repaid..."
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0009.a:0 "I will personally repay them."
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0009.b:0 "Raise the taxes in Cyrodiil."
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0009.c:0 "Being free from the Potentate should be enough!"
 attrebus_anger_elder_council:0 "This will #R anger#! the Elder Council. Unless you wish for a direct confrontation with them, it would be wise to repay them..."
 
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0011.t:0 "Peace and Prosperity"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0011.desc:0 "The war against the Potentate was won not so long ago, and yet it seems so much has changed in the last few weeks. The emergency powers given to me by the Elder Council have helped me stablize Cyrodiil, and finally bring peace to a troubled province.\n\nBut every great thing has to end, and my work here is done.\n\nI have summoned the Elder Council to formally give them back the authority they gave me. What they do with it is now not my concern."

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0012.t:0 "The Interregnum"
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0012.desc:0 "For centuries Cyrodiil and most of Tamriel was ruled by the Reman dynasty, and then the Potentate. Over the last few decades, the authority of the Imperial Province over the other regions of Tamriel diminished, until the Potentates could only claim dominion over parts of Cyrodiil.\n\nAs the Potentate finally crumbled and fell, a power vacuum in Cyrodiil appeared, quickly filled by the Elder Council who assumed control over the Imperial City and its surrounding area.\n\nThis new power, claiming legitimacy through the powers given to its council by the Alessian and Reman lines, took the name of 'Imperial Commune'.\n\nAll over the world central authorities crumble, and the people look to their nearby lord for protection. The Interregnum has officially started."
 ek_attrebus_potentate.0012.a:0 "An interesting development."

 ek_attrebus_potentate.0102.desc:0 "The impossible happened. The Potentate, surrounded by all sides by our armies and our allies, managed to secure victory after victory, until we had no choice but to surrender.

We were so sure of ourselves, of our cause, of our victory, that we never thought how what would happen if we were to leave Mundus before we could crush the Potentate. But as news of our tragic end reaches the other Lords of Cyrodiil, it seems our cause falters.\n\nThe Potentate, hidden in the Imperial City, must surely laugh at our end. Our allies and subjects, who swore an oath to never stop fighting until the end, chose to get back to their castles and cities.\n\nWithout us to lead Cyrodiil, it seems our people will stay under the Potentate."
