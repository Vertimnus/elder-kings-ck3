 ek_lifestyles.0002.d:0 "I seclude my self within my quarters, and take a small memento from [ROOT.Var('best_friend_to_commune').Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U]. I place it in the middle of a circle made of candles and various artefacts, and utter a small prayer as I prepare to bind [ROOT.Var('best_friend_to_commune').Char.GetHerHis] soul to the memento [ROOT.Var('best_friend_to_commune').Char.GetSheHe] left me. After a few minutes, I can feel a chill in the air.\n\n'[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]? Is that you?'\nI can hardly believe it. Deep within me I feared that the ritual would not work, or worse, that my beloved friend's soul would be a tortured mess.\n\nI can hardly contain my emotions, and for what felt both like a few seconds and an eternity, I spend one last moment with [ROOT.Var('best_friend_to_commune').Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U].\n\nAs the ritual draws its end, and the soul of [ROOT.Var('best_friend_to_commune').Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] leaves this world for good, I feel relieved, as I haven't been in a long time."

 ek_lifestyles.0003.d:0 "As I prepare the ritual in my quarters, I take a small memento that [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U] left me before leaving this world, and that I kept in close to my heart ever since. As I search [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetHerHis] soul outside of this plane, I hear a whisper surround me.\n\nThe presence of my dearest fills me with joy, but quickly the warm presence becomes a cold horror. The whisper turned into a painful scream, as the soul of [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] is stuck between my world and where she is supposed to rest. I must listen to the excruciating screams of [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetHerHis] soul for what feels like an eternity, before I can reverse the ritual and push [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetHerHis] back, as far away as the mortal plane as I can.\n\nAs I finally get back to my senses, I see that [ROOT.Var('soulmate_to_commune').Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U]'s memento got broken during the ritual, and my worried yet excited spirit has been replaced by an almost unbearable guilt, as even in death the love of my life cannot rest."
