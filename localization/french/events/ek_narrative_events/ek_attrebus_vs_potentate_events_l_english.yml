Over the last few decades, the authority of the Imperial Province over the other regions of Tamriel diminished, until the Potentates could only claim dominion over parts of Cyrodiil.\n\nAs the Potentate finally crumbled and fell, a power vacuum in Cyrodiil appeared, quickly filled by the Elder Council who assumed control over the Imperial City and its surrounding area.\n\nThis new power, claiming legitimacy through the powers given to its council by the Alessian and Reman lines, took the name of 'Imperial Commune'.\n\nAll over the world central authorities crumble, and the people look to their nearby lord for protection.
