  ek_narrative_intro.yashnag.desc:0 "With the collapse of the Potentate 10 years ago, Orsinium's status as an Imperial Province was void. And instead of caring about the stability of their own crumbling realms, Breton and Redguard rulers rallied behind the banner of [edgar.GetName] and his ally, [anton.GetName], to lay siege to our glorious Orsinium. Within months they breached the outer walls and started to slaughter orcs, goblins, ogres and any other race that called Orsinium its home. Weeks later [edgar.GetFirstName] slew our king in a duel, while his men razed the king's keep to the ground.\n\nIt was then that I rallied the remainder of my clan to travel east, to our ancestral lands beyond the Karth Valley: the rich region known to the Nords as Falkreath. My horde fell upon the capital of these unprepared smalltusks, where I slew their king [falk.GetFirstName] in a duel and took his Kingdom by right of conquest and by right of our ancestors."
