This is the *development version* of Elder Kings 2, an Elder Scrolls Total Conversion for Crusader Kings 3.

The mod is set within the Elder Scrolls universe created by Bethesda Softworks and has been in active development since September 2020, the same year Crusader Kings III was released. Elder Kings 2 features an entirely new world map covering the landmasses of Tamriel and Yokuda based on both official lore sources and many high quality fan sources.

# Scope
The aim of the mod is to deliver a great strategy experience to CK3 players set in the world of The Elder Scrolls. Choose any tribal or feudal ruler in the year 2E 440 or 2E 450 and guide your dynasty through the turmoil of the Interregnum.
