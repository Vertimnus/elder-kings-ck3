Cultures in EK are a bit more complex than in vanilla, due to the nativity regions

Cultures can be assigned a nativity regions, in which they can be spread and/or revived (think: Westmarcher in Western Skyrim, or Colovians in Colovia).
Each culture group can only have ONE culture in a given nativity region. Westmarchers are natives from Western Skyrim (now West Ghost Sea and White River), and no other Nordic culture can be native from somewhere around here.

When adding a new culture, you must:
	* Add it to the list in elder-kings-ck3\common\on_action\ek_game_start.txt. It's as simple as adding save_culture_in_global_list = { CULTURE = culture:YOUR_NEW_CULTURE } below an already existing culture in the culture group, or adding a new group by copy and pasting an already existing one
 
When adding a culture to a nativity group, you must:
	* Add it to the list in elder-kings-ck3\common\on_action\ek_game_start.txt. You must add set_culture_native_to = { REGION = THE_REGION CULTURE = culture:YOUR_CULTURE }. Follow the already existing lines to get the convetion.
